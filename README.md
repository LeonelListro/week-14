# Week - 14 - Automatization

In week-01 we entered like trainees, **Who would have guessed that today in week 14 we would be automating the saucedemo.com website?**
I'll tell you, **nobody**.

But well, here we are.

## In this week we are goning to do the automatization of the web page with our new friend WebDriverIO 🥰.

- First we are going to automate the login process 🤳.

- Second we are going to check the functionality of the butger menu and the sidebar buttons 🍔.

- Then let's check that all the images and inventory components are in good condition 🧐. 

- And finally we will go ahead with the purchase by checking the cart and finalising the order ✅.

That's what the week-14 brings so, let's get hands to work and let's do some good job.
